# Chameleon Enclclosure Monitoring System (CEMS)

For the past several years, I have been raising a veiled chameleon named Jeffrina. She has a lovely mesh enclosure and currently resides in a nice schefflera plant to prove hiding and hunting places. The enclosure is fairly simple but I'll break it down here:

- daylight lamp (provides vitamin D to keep her healthy)
- heat lamp (provides a place to bask and regulater her body temp)
- automated misting system

## Project Overview

Each of the core components is currently timer driven. I'd like to change that to make a more natural environment. I have three main goals:

- Control daylight lamp based on the actual lunar cycle
- Control heat lamp based on the actual enclosure temp
- Control misting duration and frequency based on actual humidity
- Monitor water level in the holding tank for the misting system

Of these requirements, monitoring the water level is the most critical at the moment. My large controller died and I was only able to source a similar system with a much smaller tank. I have to fill it constantly and it's tucked away in the cabinet under the enclosure and not entirely easy to access. I frequently run the system dry and I want to prevent that. Both for her sake and mine.
